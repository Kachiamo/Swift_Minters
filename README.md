# Swift_Minters NFT Marketplace

## Overview
The NFT Marketplace is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to mint, and buy non-fungible tokens(NFTs). NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of particular item or piece of content, such as digital art, collectibles, or virtual real estate.

## Features
### Minting
Users can create new NFTs by providing a token URI(Uniform Resource Identifier) that points to the metadata of the assest and setting a price in Ether (ETH). Minting an NFT involes creating a new token using the ERC721 standard, which ensures each token is unique and non-interchangeable.

### Listing
NFT owners can list their tokens for sale on the marketplace. When listing an NFT, the owner sets a price at which they are willing to sell the token. The NFT is then made available for purchase by other users on the platform.

### Buying
Users can browse the marketplace for listed NFT and purchase them using Ether. When a user buys an NFT, the ownership of the token is transferred to the buyer, and the seller receives the payment in Ether.

### User Wallet Integration
The marketplace integrates with popular Ethereum wallets such as MetaMask, allowing users to connect their wallets to the dApp and interact with it using their Ethereum address.

### Profile Page
Users have a profile page where they can view their listed NFTs and purchased NFTs.

### Responsive Design
The application is designed to be responsive and works well on desktop and mobile devices.
